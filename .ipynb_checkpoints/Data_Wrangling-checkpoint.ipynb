The data is collected and extracted, evaluated for quality and structural issues through both automated checks and visual inspection, and cleaned using a transparent, well-justified strategy. The refined data is stored in a selected database or data store, integrated into a unified analysis dataset, and used to answer a targeted research question. Key methodological choices are documented, and the code is annotated to support readability and reproducibility."

However, programmatic assessment showed that all rows with missing `NumericValue` also had `Value = \".\"`, meaning no additional numeric information existed to recover these observations. Because the missingness originates from the WHO source itself and not from a wrangling issue, I decided to retain these rows instead of removing them. Keeping them preserves the original dataset structure."

    "To ensure full reproducibility and meet Udacity’s rubric requirements, I created a structured folder system inside the /workspace directory. Raw datasets obtained from the WHO API and the UN World Population Prospects file were stored under /workspace/data/raw/. After performing all cleaning steps, the cleaned datasets were saved under /workspace/data/clean/. This approach keeps the original data intact, preserves multiple versions of the dataset, and maintains a clear workflow separation between gathering, cleaning, and analysis. The final merged dataset used for EDA is also stored in the cleaned data directory.\n",

I would also investigate more sophisticated methods for handling missing data and potential inconsistencies in country naming conventions. Finally, expanding the analysis to include multiple years instead of a single snapshot could reveal important long-term trends in mortality across different regions."
